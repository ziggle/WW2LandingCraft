# WW2 US Landing Craft Production

## Introduction


## Background

### US Approach

Each of the warring powers during WW2 had different logistic challenges. For Russia and German, logistics were dominated by the need to transport materials over land. I would argue the Germans failed when faced with sea transport for [Operation Sealion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Sea_Lion) For the US and UK, success in battle required a massive level of sea transport with sea-to-land transition. In the case of the US, the sea-to-land transition was handled by a variety of landing craft. 

This repo contains my data gathering of US landing craft production data.
